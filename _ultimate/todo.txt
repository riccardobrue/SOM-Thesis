IMPORTANT:
(1) try with hexagonal neurons
(2) (DONE) try to show different network topology attributes
(3) create a function for shuffling the data
(4) train the som with only 1 protocol per time (training over simulation results) --> probably it is not relevant, try point (6)
(5) (DONE) reverse the train (train the som over the network topologies--> show the efficiencies)
(6) try to visualise only one protocol per time and not only when it wins (ie: visualiza when it is >200 etc etc (split in ranges))
